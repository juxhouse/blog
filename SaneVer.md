# Sane Versioning (SaneVer)
*A Replacement for what is called "Semantic Versioning" (SemVer)*

by [Klaus Wuestefeld](https://github.com/klauswuestefeld)

"Semantic Versioning" does not work. It has failed to eliminate dependency hell, the problem it set out to solve in 2011. By creating the illusion of a solution, it has contributed to software chaos instead.

## Breaking Changes

The central problem with "Semantic Versioning" is that [it allows for breaking changes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41185023/what-exactly-is-considered-a-breaking-change-to-a-library-crate) in software artifacts, such as libraries, that are relied upon by countless other projects.
